=== SET UP COLLECTION OF SYMBOL NUMBERS ===

; !!! The symbol strategy in Ren-C is expected to move to using a fixed table
; of words that commit to their identity, as opposed to picking on each build.
; Concept would be to fit every common word that would be used in Rebol to
; the low 65535 indices, while allowing numbers beyond that to be claimed
; over time...so they could still be used in C switch() statements (but might
; have to be stored and managed in a less efficient way)
;
; For now, the symbols are gathered from the various phases, and can change
; as things are added or removed.  Hence C code using SYM_XXX must be
; recompiled with changes to the core.  These symbols aren't in libRebol,
; however, so it only affects clients of the core API for now.

=== LOAD BOOT MEZZANINE FUNCTIONS ===

; The %base-xxx.r and %mezz-xxx.r files are not run through LOAD.  This is
; because the r3.exe being used to bootstrap may be older than the Rebol it
; is building...and if LOAD is used then it means any new changes to the
; scanner couldn't be used without an update to the bootstrap executable.
;
; However, %sys-xxx.r is a library of calls that are made available to Rebol
; by means of static ID numbers.  The way the #define-s for these IDs were
; made involved LOAD-ing the objects.  While we could rewrite that not to do
; a LOAD as well, keep it how it was for the moment.
